**Problem Statement :** </br></br>
The user wants to send out emails to 50k email addresses at a time, we need a form to take input of email addresses from the user. While designing the page, keep in mind that it should be user friendly (eg. he should be able to copy-paste 50k emails at a time from excel). On entering the input, it should be validated and incorrect email formats should be highlighted. On having all valid emails, the proceed button should get activated. On clicking the Proceed button, an ajax call should be made with all email address in the POST request payload (for now, assume any endpoint for the ajax call)</br></br>
